Python challeges using budget_data.csv and election_data.csv are complete.

PyBank:
I find the differences in profit/losses and append to a list. Then use the list index to locate the greatest and lowest increase. Use that index to write the date and the difference to the output file. 



PyPoll:
I imported the Collections module and used the Counter to find candidates with their votes. I used the most_common() function to determine the winner. I used the reader module and iterated to find the total number of votes cast. The results are written to a text file in the required format.
