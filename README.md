Python challeges using budget_data.csv and election_data.csv are complete.
PyBank:
The approach is to create a new budget_data_1.csv with 3 columns titled: Date, Profit/Losses, Difference. The third column is constructed using a list called chng[] by find the differences in the profit/losses. I have 2 functions that retrieve only the Date and Increase/Decrease in profits. I used this new csv to read the results and export to output file. 

PyPoll:
I imported the Collections module and used the Counter to find candidates with their votes. I used the most_common() function to determine the winner. I used the reader module and iterated to find the total number of votes cast. The results are written to a text file in the required format.
